# Three.js Journey Notes (Bruno Simon)

Notes collected while following [Bruno Simon's Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) — building interactive WebGL experiences from the basics (scenes, cameras, meshes) through transforms, materials, lighting, animation, and production-ready workflows.

## Contents
- [03-first-threejs-project](03-first-threejs-project/readme.md) — minimal Vite + Three.js setup steps and “why the screen was black” notes.
- [04-transform-objects](04-transform-objects/readme.md) — recap of positioning, scaling, rotation order, grouping, and using helpers like `AxesHelper` and `lookAt`.

## How to use
- Jump into a lesson folder, read its `readme.md`, then run the listed scripts to try the examples.
- Add new lesson notes in their own subfolder with a brief `readme.md` so this index stays up to date.
