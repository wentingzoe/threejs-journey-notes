# Three.js Journey Notes (Bruno Simon)

Notes collected while following Bruno Simon's Three.js Journey course — building interactive WebGL experiences from the basics (scenes, cameras, meshes) through transforms, materials, lighting, animation, and production-ready workflows.

## Contents
- `03-first-threejs-project/readme.md` — base starter from the first project lesson; how to install deps and run the local dev server.
- `04-transform-objects/readme.md` — recap of positioning, scaling, rotation order, grouping, and using helpers like `AxesHelper` and `lookAt`.

## How to use
- Jump into a lesson folder, read its `readme.md`, then run the listed scripts to try the examples.
- Add new lesson notes in their own subfolder with a brief `readme.md` so this index stays up to date.
